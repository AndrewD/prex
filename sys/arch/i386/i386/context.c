 * The context consists of kernel/user mode registers, and

 * kernel stack when processor enters kernel mode by H/W or S/W events.
 *
 * The user mode registers are located in the interrupt/trap frame
 * at the top of the kernel stack. Before the control returns to user
 * mode next time, these register value will be restored automatically.
 *
 * All thread owns its context to keep its execution state. The
 * scheduler will switch the context to change an active thread.
