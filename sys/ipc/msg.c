/*
 * msg.c - routines to transmit a message.
 */

/*
 * Design:
 *
 * Messages are sent to the specific object by using msg_send().
 * The transmission of a message is completely synchronous with
 * this kernel. This means the thread which sent a message is
 * blocked until it receives a response from another thread.
 * msg_receive() performs reception of a message. msg_receive() is
 * also blocked when no message is reached to the target object.
 * The receiver thread must answer the message using msg_reply()
 * after it finishes its message processing.
 *
 * The receiver thread can not receive another message until it
 * replies to the sender. In short, a thread can receive only one
 * message at once. Once the thread receives message, it can send
 * another message to different object. This mechanism allows
 * threads to redirect the sender's request to another thread.
 *
 * The message is copied from thread to thread directly without any
 * kernel buffering. If sent message contains a buffer, sender's
 * memory region is automatically mapped to the receiver's memory
 * in kernel. Since there is no page out of memory in this system,
 * we can copy the message data via physical memory at anytime.
