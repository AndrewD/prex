 * mutex.c - mutual exclusion service.
 */

/*
 * A mutex is used to protect un-sharable resources.
 * A thread can use mutex_lock() to ensure that global resource is not
 * accessed by other thread. The mutex is effective only the threads
 * belonging to the same task.
 *
 * Prex will change the thread priority to prevent priority inversion.
 *
 * <Priority inheritance>
 *   The priority is changed at the following conditions.
 *
 *   1. When the current thread can not lock the mutex and its mutex
 *      owner has lower priority than current thread, the priority
 *      of mutex owner is boosted to same priority with current thread.
 *      If this mutex owner is waiting for another mutex, such related
 *      mutexes are also processed.
 *
 *   2. When the current thread unlocks the mutex and its priority
 *      has already been inherited, the current priority is reset.
 *      In this time, the current priority is changed to the highest
 *      priority among the threads waiting for the mutexes locked by
 *      current thread.
 *
 *   3. When the thread priority is changed by user request, the inherited
 *      thread's priority is changed.
 *
 * <Limitation>
 *
 *   1. If the priority is changed by user request, the priority
 *      recomputation is done only when the new priority is higher
 *      than old priority. The inherited priority is reset to base
 *      priority when the mutex is unlocked.
 *
 *   2. Even if thread is killed with mutex waiting, the related
 *      priority is not adjusted.
 *
 * <Important>
 *  Since this implementation does not support recursive lock, a thread
 *  can not lock the same mutex twice.
