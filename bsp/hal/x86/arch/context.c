 * The context consists of kernel/user mode registers, and kernel

 *
 * The user mode registers are located in the interrupt/trap
 * frame at the top of the kernel stack. Before the control
 * returns to user mode next time, these register value will be
 * restored automatically.

 * All thread owns its context to keep its execution state. The
