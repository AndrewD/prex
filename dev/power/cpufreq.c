/*
 * Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS)
 *
 * DVS is widely used with mobile systems to save the processor
 * power consumption, with minimum impact on performance.
 * The basic idea is come from the fact the power consumption is
 * proportional to V^2 x f, where V is voltage and f is frequency.
 * Since processor does not always require the full performance,
 * we can reduce power consumption by lowering voltage and frequeceny.

 * Predict CPU speed.

 * DVS Algorithm: Weiser Style
 *
 *  If the utilization prediction x is high (over 70%), increase the
 *  speed by 20% of the maximum speed. If the utilization prediction
 *  is low (under 50%), decrease the speed by (60 - x)% of the
 *  maximum speed.
 *
 *  excess_cycles is defined as the number of uncompleted run cycles
 *  from the last interval. For example, if we find 70% activity
 *  when runnig at full speed, and their processor speed was set to
 *  50% during that interval, excess_cycles is set to 20%. This
 *  value (20%) is used to calculate the processor speed in the next
