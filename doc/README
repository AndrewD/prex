                       Prex Operating System


What is Prex?
-------------

The Prex project is an open source initiative to provide a portable
real-time operating system for embedded systems. Prex is designed
specifically for small footprint platforms. It is written in C language
from scratch based on a traditional micro kernel architecture.
The Prex kernel provides only fundamental features for task, thread, memory,
ipc, exception, and synchronization. The other basic OS functions such
like process, file system, application loading, and networking are provided
by user mode servers on top of the Prex kernel. This design allows systems
to execute both of native real-time task and generic UNIX process
simultaneously, without degrading the real-time performance. Futhermore, it
helps the platform designer to construct OS by choosing appropriate server
tasks for their target requirements.

Current Port
------------

Available port (arch-platform):

  - i386-pc
  - i386-nommu
  - arm-gba


How to Build?
-------------

Step 1: Prepare Toolchain

  The following packages are required for compiling Prex.
  - GCC 3.3.1 or later
  - GNU Binutils 2.15 or later
  - GNU Make

  The toolchain should be built appropriately for your target 
  architecture to cross-compile Prex.

Step 2: Prepare Sources

  Unpack the sources and move to the top level directory of the source tree.

  $ cd /usr/src
  $ tar zxvf prex-X.X.X.tar.gz
  $ cd prex-X.X.X

Step 3: Configure

  Setup target architecture and platform.
  The following sample shows about i386-pc target.

  $ export PREX_ARCH=i386
  $ export PREX_PLATFORM=pc
  $ export PREX_SRC=/usr/src/prex-X.X.X

  If you cross compile Prex from a different architecture and/or OS,
  you have to set CROSS_COMPILE variable. The following sample shows
  the compiling Prex on Cygwin.

  $ export CROSS_COMPILE=i386-elf-

Step 4: Build

  Run make (and pray :)

  $ make
